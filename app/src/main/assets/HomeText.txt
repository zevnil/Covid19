In December 2019, the Chinese authorities
\nnotified the world that a virus was spreading
\nthrough their communities.In the following
\nmonths, it spread to other countries, with
\ncases doubling within days. This virus is the
\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related
\nCoronavirus 2 (or SARS-COV-2), that causes
\nthe infectious disease COVID-19 (or
\nCoronavirus Disease 2019).
\n
\nThe disease was first identified in December
\n2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China\'s Hubei
\nprovince, and has since spread globally,
\nresulting in the ongoing 2019â€“20
\ncoronavirus pandemic. The World Health Organization
\ndeclared the outbreak a Public Health
\nEmergency of International Concern on
\n30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March. As
\ncases of 29 April 2020, more than
\n3.17 million have been reported across 185
\ncountries and territories, resulting in more
\nthan 224,000 deaths. More than 958,000 people
\nhave recovered.
\n
\nThe virus is primarily spread between people
\nduring close contact, often via small droplets
\nproduced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
\nCommon symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue,
\nshortness of breath, and loss of smell.
\nComplications may include pneumonia and acute
\nrespiratory distress syndrome.
\n
\nThe pandemic has caused severe global
\nsocioeconomic disruption, including the largest
\nglobal recession since the Great Depression.
\nIt has led to the postponement or cancellation
\nof sporting, religious, political and cultural
\nevents, widespread supply shortages exacerbated
\nby panic buying, and decreased emissions of
\npollutants and greenhouse gases. Schools,
\nuniversities and colleges have closed either
\non a nationwide or local basis in 194 countries,
\naffecting approximately 98.5 per cent of the
\nworld's student population. Misinformation
\nabout the virus has spread online, and there
\nhave been incidents of xenophobia and
\ndiscrimination against Chinese people and
\nagainst those perceived as being Chinese, or
\nas being from areas with high infection rates.
