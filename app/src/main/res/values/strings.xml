    <string name="app_name">Covid19</string>
    <string name= "homeText1">In December 2019, the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities.In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 (or SARS-COV 2), that causes the infectious disease COVID-19 (or Coronavirus Disease 2019).\n</string>
    <string name="homeText2">The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China\'s Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March. As of 29 April 2020, more than 3.17 million cases have been reported across 185 countries and territories, resulting in more than 224,000 deaths. More than 958,000 people have recovered.\n</string>
    <string name="homeText3">The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n</string>
    <string name="homeText4">The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression. It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.</string>
    <string name="homeText5">Schools, universities and colleges have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 194 countries, affecting approximately 98.5 per cent of the world\'s student population. Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese, or as being from areas with high infection rates.\n</string>
    <string name="transmissionHeading">Transmission\n</string>
    <string name="transmissionText1">As COVID-19 is a new disease, many aspects of how it is spread are under investigation.\n</string>
    <string name="transmissionText2">1. The disease is spread during close contact, often by small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking.[8] These droplets can be inhaled by other people when in close contact (1 to 2 metres, 3 to 6 feet)\n</string>
    <string name="transmissionText3">2. Being relatively heavy, these droplets can fall on objects and surfaces around the sick person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails. People can become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.\n</string>
    <string name="transmissionText4">3. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread is known to occur up to two days before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. Therefore, transmission is possible before symptoms develop.\n\n\n\n</string>
    <string name="symptomsHeading">Symptoms\n</string>
    <string name="symptomsText1">Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.\n</string>
    <string name="symptomsText2">1. The the most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent), dry cough (68 per cent) and tiredness.\n</string>
    <string name="symptomsText3">2. Other symptoms include respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell (only 15 per cent), shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, and diarrhea.\n</string>
    <string name="symptomsText4">3. Severe (emergency) symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips.\n</string>
    <string name="symptomsText5">4. Further development of the disease can lead to potentially fatal complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.\n</string>
    <string name="symptomsText6">Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Some of those infected may even remain asymptomatic (upto 44 percent). Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer , are at higher risk of developing serious illness.</string>
    <string name="symptomsText7">\nHowever anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill. Even people with very mild symptoms of COVID-19 can transmit the virus. People of all ages who experience fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.\n</string>
